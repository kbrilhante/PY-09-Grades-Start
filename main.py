# CHALLENGE:
# We have a dictionary with a list of students and their grades
# The goal is to calculate the average of each student and the final grade
# The grade is based on the table:
# |     AVG    | GRADE |
# | 10.0 - 9.0 |   A   |
# | <9.0 - 8.0 |   B   |
# | <8.0 - 7.0 |   C   |
# | <7.0 - 6.0 |   D   |
# |    <6.0    |   F   |

# EVEN MORE CHALLENGING CHALLENGE:
# Build a menu that allows the user to pick a student and get their info
